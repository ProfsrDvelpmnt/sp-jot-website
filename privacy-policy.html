                    <h3>Personal information you disclose to us</h3>
                    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We collect personal information that you provide to us.</p>
                    
                    <p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services or otherwise when you contact us.</p>
                    
                    <p>The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect may include the following:</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Personal Information Provided by You.</strong> We collect information including names; phone numbers; email addresses; mailing addresses; usernames; passwords; contact preferences; contact or authentication data; billing addresses; debit/credit card numbers; employment information, job application details, interview schedules, salary expectations, career goals, skills and qualifications, work experience, education information, and other job-related information provided by you directly. We may collect information including date of birth, age, geographic location, address, and information available on your LinkedIn profile or on your resume provided by you. We may also store job opportunity information you track including company names, job titles, application dates, application status, contact information for recruiters and hiring managers, interview notes, and follow-up reminders.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Payment Data.</strong> Through our payment processing vendors, we may collect payment card information necessary to process your payment if you make purchases, such as your payment instrument number (such as a credit card number), and the security code associated with your payment instrument. All payment data is stored directly by our payment processor; we do not store any payment card data directly.</p>
                    
                    <p>All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.</p>

                    <h3>Information collected automatically</h3>
                    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We collect personal information automatically as you navigate our Services.</p>
                    
                    <p>We and our service providers may use cookies and similar technologies to collect usage and browser information about how you use our Services. The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include cookies and web beacons that permit us to verify system and server integrity and generate statistics around the popularity of certain content. We process the information collected through such technologies, which may include or be combined with personal information, to help operate certain features of our Services, to enhance your experience through personalization, and to help us better understand the features of our Services that you and other users are most interested in.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Website Delivery and Appearance</strong> – We may use third-party providers to enable certain customer interaction opportunities, content delivery (like audio or video), or other service capabilities. For example, we partner with service providers to host our Services and deliver specific content in support of our Services.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Website Analytics and Session Replay</strong> – We use analytics and session replay services that use cookies and other technologies that collect your Personal Information, to assist us with analyzing our traffic and usage to optimize, maintain, and secure our Services and inform subsequent business decisions. These may include Google Analytics and similar services.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Interest-Based Advertising</strong> – We may also allow or enable third parties to collect personal information to provide their interest-based advertising on behalf of our products and services, or their own. Interest-based advertising occurs when advertisements are shown to you based on information collected from your online interactions over time and across multiple websites, devices, or online services that you visit or use.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Cookie Choices</strong> – To manage your preferences with respect to these technologies, you can change your cookie preferences by customizing your browser settings to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable certain cookies, please note that some parts of our Services may not function properly.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Browser Extension Data Collection</h3>
                    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Our browser extension collects job posting information only when you actively choose to capture job listings.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our browser extension collects job posting information from authorized job sites (LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.) only when users actively choose to capture job listings. The extension requires authentication with your SavvyPro JOT account to ensure data syncs securely to your personal job tracking pipeline. We do not automatically collect or store job posting data without your explicit action to capture specific job listings.</p>
